# Eat Da Burger!

Welcome to "Eat Da Burger," where you can add your own burgers that you want to eat, then eat them (virtually, of course)! Your entries go into a database and whether or not they have been eaten also gets updated in real time. This application uses JavaScript and MongoDB for the most part.
